TRANSCRIPTOMICS

In the shared folder you will find the files:
- single-omics_ex_sel_genes_2016 
-single-omics_ex_sel_genes_2021

… which contain 2 files each, i.e.:
the Pan-glioma matrix "raw"
“ “ “ and normalised


Yet:
I was thinking about the datasets.... I think it is better to consider "raw" data (i.e. the one extracted from TCGA), because there should be "problems" with normally distributed variables. Indeed, for the analysis I considered each subtype separately, then the variables have been normalized by considering less samples than the one included in the Pan-glioma matrix. This implies that, when we bind the subtype, the variables could be no more normally distributed.

Therefore,
I think that original data would be preferable for a more consistent analysis


METHYLOMICS

- multi-omics_DNAmeth

which contain 4 files, i.e. the Pan-glioma matrix with "raw" and normalised variables for commonly selected gene strategy (CS) and exclusively selected gene strategy (ES).  


SURVIVAL ANALYSIS ((not normalized matrix))

single omics 
single-omics_ex_sel_genes_2016 
single-omics_ex_sel_genes_2021 

multi omics 
Pan_glioma_CS_DNAmeth
Pan_glioma_ES_DNAmeth


The survival analysis should be done with and without variable selection (EN?).
